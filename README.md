### Greetings from The Netherlands ðŸ‘‹

My name is VAC Efron, and I'm a Dutch-Armenian developer and first-year CS student. I spend most of my time coding in C#. I also know HTML, CSS and a bit of Python. I'm usually working on my [Discord bot](https://konek0.nl/), along with some other projects when I'm inspired.
